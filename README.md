The name of the project stands for satellite photo. This is my first institutional practice. I need to process (segment) a satellite photo.

<h2 align="center">How does this code work</h2>

1. First we need a file called "a program for selecting color parameters.py" and an experimental image "ng.png".
        
2. Download them to one folder (we donâ€™t move the file from this folder anywhere), go to the console, go to the desired file and run the script with standard commands (respectively):
```
cd 

python name.py
```
3. In the window that opens, we play with the parameters h1, s1,...,v2 until the necessary elements of the river turn white and everything else black.
4. We write them down. 
5. Now download and open the main program "blue (white).py", where we substitute the previously recorded parameters. 
6. Run the script (see point 2) and see the result.
